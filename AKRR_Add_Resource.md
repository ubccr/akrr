This section describes how to add traditional HPC resource to AKRR. AKRR also support
execution on systems without queueing system and [OpenStack](AKRR_Add_OpenStack_Resource_and_AppKernels.md.md) (limited support at this point).  


# Adding a New HPC Resource

HPC resource is added in two steps:

1) Configuration of new resource
2) Deployment of AKRR's HPC resource-side scripts and application inputs.

The last step also performs installation validation.

From the AKRR point of view, an HPC resource is a distinct and **homogeneous 
set** of computational nodes. The resource name should reflect such a set. For 
example,  if cluster "A" in addition to typical general purpose nodes has 
specialized nodes ( large memory, GPU or MIC accelerated nodes), it will be 
convenient to treat them as a separate resources and to name them as "A",  
"A_largemem", "A_GPU" and "A_MIC" for general purpose nodes, for large memory 
nodes, GPU or MIC accelerated nodes respectively. The name of the resource is 
separated from access node  (head node), the later is specified in configuration 
file.

AKRR uses the user-account under which its is running to access HPC resources. 
For the access, it will use ssh and scp commands.

# Required Information about Resource

*   Access credential to head node from machine where AKRR daemon is running 
(username and password or username, private key location on file system and 
pass-phrase)
*   Queuing system type (SLURM, PBS)
*   Batch job script header with resource request specifications
*   HPC resource specification
    *   processes per node count
*   HPC resource file-system layout
    *   local scratch location
    *   network scratch location
    *   future location for application kernel input and auxiliary files (should 
be in persistent location (i.e. not scratch))
    *   future location for application kernel run-time files (can be on 
scratch)

# Prerequerements

## Setting HPC Resource Default Shell to BASH

AKRR accesses and uses HPC resource as a regular user and as a regular user it 
has its' preference to shell flavor. It is intended to be used with bash. Consult your system 
user guide or consultants on how to do that, please note that in the majority of 
large HPC sites the UNIX _chsh_ command is not the preferred way.

# Adding New Resource

To add new resource run AKRR CLI with _resource add_ options:

```bash
akrr resource add
```

This script will:

*   ask to choose a resource from OpenXDMoD resources list
*   prompt for AKRR resource name
*   ask for a queuing system
*   ask for resource access credential
*   ask for locations of AKRR working directories on resource
*   finally it initiate resource configuration file and populate most of the 
parameters in it 

If the resource is not present in OpenXDMoD resources list enter 0 when prompt 
for resoure id. When prompt for resource name enter human friendly name as 
discussed earlier, for example _fatboy_gpu, the name can be different from 
XDMoD name._

> **Tips and Tricks**
>
> If resource headnode do not reply on pinging use __--no-ping__ argument do disable that check.
>
> If your system is fairly non-standard (for example non-default port for ssh, 
> usage of globus-ssh for access and similar) you can use __--minimalistic__ argument.
> This option sets a minimalistic interactive session and the generated 
> configuration file must be manually edited.

Below is sample output:

## Edit Resource Configuration File

Edit resource parameter file $HOME/akrr/etc/resources/\<RESOURCE\>/resource.conf 
. In most cases the only parameter which should be 
adjusted is _batch_job_header_template_ at the end of the file.

Below is example of the resource configuration file:

```python
# Resource parameters

# Processors (cores) per node
ppn = 8

# head node for remote access
remote_access_node = "huey"
# Remote access method to the resource (default ssh)
remote_access_method = "ssh"
# Remote copy method to the resource (default scp)
remote_copy_method = "scp"

# Access authentication
ssh_username = "nikolays"
ssh_password = None
ssh_private_key_file = None
ssh_private_key_password = None

# Scratch visible across all nodes (absolute path or/and shell environment variable)
network_scratch = "/user/nikolays/tmp"
# Local scratch only locally visible (absolute path or/and shell environment variable)
local_scratch = "/tmp"
# Locations for app. kernels working directories (can or even should be on scratch space)
akrr_data = "/user/nikolays/tmp/akrr_data/ub-hpc"
# Location of executables and input for app. kernels
appkernel_dir = "/user/nikolays/appker/ub-hpc"

# batch options
batch_scheduler = "slurm"

# job script header
batch_job_header_template = """#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --partition=normal
#SBATCH --qos=normal
#SBATCH --nodes={akrr_num_of_nodes}
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node={akrr_ppn}
#SBATCH --time={akrr_walltime_limit}
#SBATCH --output={akrr_task_work_dir}/stdout
#SBATCH --error={akrr_task_work_dir}/stderr
#SBATCH --exclusive
"""
```

> **Configuration File Format**
>
> All AKRR configuration files utilize python syntax. Below is a short example on the syntax:
> 
> ```python
> # pound sign for comments
> 
> # value assignment to variable
> db_host = "127.0.0.1"
> export_db_host = db_host
> 
> # triple quotes for long multi-line strings
> batch_job_header_template = """#!/bin/bash
> #SBATCH --partition=normal
> #SBATCH --nodes={akrr_num_of_nodes}
> #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node={akrr_ppn}
> #SBATCH --time={akrr_walltime_limit}
> #SBATCH --output={akrr_task_work_dir}/stdout
> #SBATCH --error={akrr_task_work_dir}/stderr
> #SBATCH --exclusive
> """
> ```

Batch job script files which is submited to HPC resource for execution is 
generated using the template. Variables 
in curly brackets are replaced by their values.

For example line "#SBATCH --nodes={akrrNNodes}" listed above in 
batchJobHeaderTemplate template variable

will become "#SBATCH --nodes=2" in batch job script if application kernel should 
run on two nodes.

In order to enter curly brackets itself they should be enter as double curly 
brackets (i.e. ${{ENV_VAR}} in template will be ${ENV_VAR} in resulting script).

The commented parameters will assume default values. Below is the description of 
the parameters and their default values:

_batch_job_header_template _is a template used in the generation of batch job 
scripts. It specifies the resources (e.g. number of nodes) and other parameters 
used by scheduler.

The following are instructions on how to convert batch job script header to _batch_job_header_template_. 

<!---
For more details see [Batch Job Script Generation](AKRR_Batch_Job_Script_Generation.md). 
--->

Below is a batch script which execute NAMD application on resorch which use Slurm:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --partition=general-compute 
#SBATCH --qos=general-compute
#SBATCH --nodes=2
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=8
#SBATCH --time=01:00:00
#SBATCH --output=output.stdout
#SBATCH --error=output.stderr
#SBATCH --constraint="CPU-L5520"
#SBATCH --exclusive

module load namd

srun $NAMDHOME/namd2 ./input.namd >& output.log 
```

We need to cut the top part of it, use it to replace the top section in the 
_batch_job_header_template _variable, and replace the requested resources with 
suitable template variables:

```python
batch_job_header_template = """#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --partition=general-compute 
#SBATCH --qos=general-compute
#SBATCH --nodes={akrr_num_of_nodes}
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node={akrr_ppn}
#SBATCH --time={akrr_walltime_limit}
#SBATCH --output={akrr_task_work_dir}/stdout
#SBATCH --error={akrr_task_work_dir}/stderr
#SBATCH --constraint="CPU-L5520"
#SBATCH --exclusive
"""
```

Number of nodes became _{akrr_num_of_nodes}_, processors per node became 
_{akrr_ppn}_, walltime becomes _{akrr_walltime_limit} and standard output and error 
became _{akrr_task_work_dir}/stdout_ and _{akrr_task_work_dir}/stderr_ respectively. 
These template variables 
will be substituted by the desired values during generation of batch job script 
for a particular task. The name of the files to where the standard output and 
error are redirected **always** should be stdout and stderr respectively.

Some template variable often used in batchJobHeaderTemplate is shown in table 
below:

| Variable Name         | Description                                                                      |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| {akrr_num_of_nodes}   | Number of requested nodes                                                        |
| {akrr_ppn}            | Processors per node count, that means a total count of cores on a single node    |
| {akrr_num_of_cores}   | Number of requested cores                                                        |
| {akrr_walltime_limit} | Requested walltime, this field will be properly formatted                        |
| {akrr_task_work_dir}  | Location of working directory where the application kernel will be executed.     |
|                       | It is often used to redirect standard error and output to proper location, e.g.: |
|                       |     #SBATCH --output={akrr_task_work_dir}/stdout                                 |

|                       | Although such explicit definition of standard error and output redirected files are rarely used. | 
|                       | Some batch systems have been known to default to placing such output files in the user $HOME directory rather than the job submission directory. |

## Visual Inspection of Generated Batch Job Script

Now, we can generate test application kernel batch job script and visually 
inspect it for mistake presence. Run:

```bash
akrr task new --dry-run --gen-batch-job-only -r <resource_name> -a test -n 2
```

This command will generate batch job script and output it to standard output. 
Below is example of the output

```text

# Resource Parameters Validation and Application Kernel Input Parameters Deployment

The following command will validate resource parameters and deploy application 
kernel input parameters

```bash
akrr resource deploy -r <resource_name>
```

This script will perform following operations:

*   Check configuration file syntax, parameters type and presence of non 
optional parameters
*   Test the connectivity to the head-node
*   Deploy application kernel input parameters and application signature 
calculator
*   Run a test job on the resource

The script will exit in case of failure. The error must be addressed and script

# Troubleshooting

## Incorrect $AKRR_NODELIST Environment variable

If you got following error messages:

* "Nodes are not detected, check batch_job_header_template and setup of AKRR_NODELIST 
  variable"
* "Can not ping compute nodes from head node"
* "Number of requested processes (processes per node \* nodes) do not match actual 
  processes executed"

Then there is a high chances that AKRR_NODELIST was not set properly from 
default templates.

AKRR_NODELIST is a list of nodes per each MPI process, i.e. same node name is 
repeated multiple times. For example for 2 node run on 4 cores per node machine 
it looks like "node3 node3 node3 node3 node7node7node7node7".

  

By default AKRR uses templates specific to queuing system (defined in 
$AKRR_HOME/src/default.resource.inp.py):

```python
#Node list setter
node_list_setter={
    'pbs':"""export AKRR_NODELIST=\`cat $PBS_NODEFILE\`""",
    'slurm':"""export AKRR_NODELIST=\`srun -l --ntasks-per-node=$AKRR_CORES_PER_NODE -n $AKRR_CORES hostname -s|sort -n| awk '{{printf "%s ",$2}}' \`"""
}
```

To modify the behavior node_list_setter_template can be define in specific resource 
configuration file ($AKRR_HOME/cfg/resources/$RESOURCE/resource.inp.py):

**portion of $AKRR_HOME/cfg/resources/$RESOURCE/resource.inp.py**

```python
#Node list setter
node_list_setter_template="""export AKRR_NODELIST=`srun -l --ntasks-per-node=$AKRR_CORES_PER_NODE -n $AKRR_CORES hostname -s|sort -n| awk '{{printf "%s ",$2}}' `"""
```

For SLURM alternative to srun can be:

**portion of $AKRR_HOME/cfg/resources/$RESOURCE/resource.inp.py**

```python
#Node list setter
node_list_setter_template="""_TASKS_PER_NODE=`echo $SLURM_TASKS_PER_NODE|sed "s/(x[0-9]*)//g"`
export AKRR_NODELIST=`scontrol show hostname $SLURM_NODELIST| awk "{{for (i=0;i<$_TASKS_PER_NODE;++i)print}}"
"""
```

# Advanced Debugging

Although resource_validation_and_deployment.py detects many problems with 
resource deployments, sometimes its output can be cryptic. The following 
strategy can be employed to find the problem.

1.  Generate batch job script
2.  Run it on resource
3.  Analyze output
4.  Fix the issues in batch job script
5.  Go to 2 until executed successfully
6.  merge changes in batch job script to respective template in configuration 
file

Batch job script can be generated by running following command:

```bash
akrr task new --gen-batch-job-only -r <resource_name> -a test -n 2
```

This command generate batch job script and copy it to proper location on remote 
resource. This location will be showed in output:

```text
[INFO]: Local copy of batch job script is 
/home/mikola/wsp/test/akrr/data/rush/test/2014.12.11.08.58.57.412410/jobfiles/
test.job

[INFO]: Application kernel working directory on rush is 
/panasas/scratch/nikolays/akrrdata/rush/test/2014.12.11.08.58.57.412410
[INFO]: Batch job script location on rush is 
/panasas/scratch/nikolays/akrrdata/rush/test/2014.12.11.08.58.57.412410/test.job
```

Now log into resource, go to the task working directory and manually submit to 
queue, check the output and determine the problem.
