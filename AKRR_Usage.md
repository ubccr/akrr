# AKRR Usage

It can be most useful to understand [how AKRR generate batch scripts](AKRR_Batch_Job_Script_Generation.md) 
which are later submitted for execution on HPC resource. This will help with understanding how configuration works. 

First you need to  [add HPC resource](AKRR_Add_Resource.md) to AKRR, 
then [Application Kernel should be installed](AKRR_Deployment_of_Application_Kernel_on_Resource.md) 
on that resource. After these two steps
[the appkernels periodic execution](AKRR_Tasks_Scheduling.md) can be set.



Next: [Add HPC resource](AKRR_Add_Resource.md)
